# Portfolio Website Optimization Guide

This document outlines the optimizations implemented to reduce memory usage and improve performance of your personal portfolio website.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimizations
- Converted images to WebP format for better compression
- Added proper image sizing with the `sizes` attribute
- Implemented lazy loading for non-critical images
- Added blur placeholders for better loading experience
- Reduced image quality to 75% (from 80-85%) for better performance while maintaining visual quality

### 2. JavaScript Optimizations
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized framer-motion animations to reduce CPU usage
- Added debouncing for expensive operations
- Implemented proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
- Reduced animation complexity and duration

### 3. Next.js Configuration Optimizations
- Enabled SWC minification for faster builds
- Configured image optimization settings
- Disabled X-Powered-By header for security
- Enabled React strict mode
- Added compression
- Set output to standalone for optimized deployment

### 4. Font Optimizations
- Implemented font preloading and display swap
- Added system font fallbacks
- Used DNS prefetch and preconnect for Google Fonts

### 5. SEO and Metadata Optimizations
- Enhanced metadata for better SEO
- Added proper viewport settings
- Implemented OpenGraph tags

## How to Run Optimization Scripts

### Optimize Images
```bash
npm run optimize-images
```

### Analyze JavaScript Bundles
```bash
# First, set up the analyzer
npm run analyze-setup

# Then run the analysis
npm run analyze
```

### Run All Optimizations
```bash
npm run optimize
```

## Performance Monitoring

To monitor the performance of your website:

1. Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
2. Check Lighthouse scores
3. Monitor memory usage with the Memory tab in Chrome DevTools

## Additional Optimization Opportunities

1. **Code Splitting**: Consider implementing more code splitting for large components
2. **Server-Side Rendering**: Utilize Next.js SSR capabilities for faster initial load
3. **Service Worker**: Add a service worker for offline support and caching
4. **Critical CSS**: Extract and inline critical CSS for faster rendering
5. **Third-Party Script Management**: Defer non-critical third-party scripts

## Memory Usage Reduction

The implemented optimizations should significantly reduce memory usage by:

1. Preventing memory leaks from event listeners
2. Optimizing image loading and rendering
3. Reducing unnecessary re-renders
4. Implementing proper cleanup functions
5. Using more efficient animation techniques

These optimizations should result in a smoother user experience, faster load times, and reduced memory footprint.
